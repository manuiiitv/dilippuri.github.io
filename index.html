<p>
Our work uses the computed tomography (CT) images given by LIDC-IDRI database to classify the nodules present in these images as malignant or benign. We have performed our method on 6306 CT images and achieved the test accuracy of 84.13% along with the sensitivity of 91.69% and specificity of 73.16%, clearly outperforming the state of art results.<br>

Pratik Shah , Assistant Professor, IIIT Vadodara
<p>This project was started to prevent the accidents caused by road anomalies and one feature of road anomalies which we consider was the speed breakers. The application can predict the upcoming speed breakers for the drivers and show the location of the breakers on the map along with the warning of the same in their smart phones. Accelerometer readings from the phone are used to calculate the position of the speed breakers. This project was done in a group of four and my role was to analyze the readings of accelerometer for the detection of speed breaker.

Guide: Jignesh Bhatt , Assistant Professor, IIIT Vadodara
<p>
In this project we have used image steganography for communication between client and server. Through this project we have implemented the methodology, which first uses the least significant bit subsitution to secretly encode the message in image, transfer it through the channel and then to decode it at the receiver’s end.

Guide : JPratik Shah , Assistant Professor, IIIT Vadodara
<p>In our exploratory project, we evaluated Newtons method (Newton Raphson Method) for finding out real and complex roots of polynomial functions, and analysed the resulting Newton basins of Attraction. A Newton basin is the set of points (initial guesses) which converges
to a particular solution after certain Newton iterations. We took different examples of polynomial functions, calculated their roots (both real and complex) using Newton’s method and evaluated the resulting Newton basins. We also explored the different applications and limitations of Newton’s method.
